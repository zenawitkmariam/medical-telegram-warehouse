      "The main complaints about credit cards include issues with credit card applications being denied (Complaint 1), concerns about predatory terms and promotional offers (Complaint 2), disputes related to purchases shown on statements (Complaint 4), and problems with making payments (Complaint 5). Additionally, there are complaints about the resolution process for credit card issues, as mentioned in Complaint 3.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Answer:**\n",
      "Customers are unhappy with CrediTrust Financial's personal loans due to several issues. Some complaints revolve around unclear communication regarding loan approval, taking out the loan or lease (Complaints 1, 2), and misleading information provided during the application process. Another common theme is problems with the payoff process at the end of the loan and a lack of transparency about internal issues (Complaint 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, customers have expressed concerns about difficulties when they are unable to pay, including a lack of friendly hardship assistance for subprime loans, refusal to help during financial hardships, and accounts being sent to collections (Complaints 4, 5). Furthermore, some clients are unhappy that their loan accounts are not reported to credit bureaus unless there are negative accounts (Complaint 3).\n",

      "\n",
      "**Answer:**\n",

    "- Retrieval finds relevant complaints for each query\n",
    "- Product filtering works correctly\n",

    "### Limitations\n",

    "- L2 distance doesn't normalize for vector magnitude\n",

    "- Add reranker for better relevance\n",
    "- Deduplicate by complaint_id\n",
